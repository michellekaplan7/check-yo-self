# Check Yo' Self

## Overview
Check Yo' Self is an app that allows a user to create a todo list.

## Goals
The user can type in the title of their task and task items to put into their todo list. Upon clicking the "Make Task List" button, a todo list will populate on the right side of the page. Once the user completes a task, the user can click on the task and the task will be checked off.

While I didn't get to more functionality, with more time, the user should also be able to:
- Delete a todo card once all tasks are complete
- Mark a task urgent if it's a higher priority
- Click on the "Filter by Urgency" button on the left side and have only the urgent todos appear
- Type in the search bar for a task and have only that task appear, based on its' title and task items.
- The ability to edit tasks and to add more tasks to each todo card

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Chrome Dev Tools
- Atom text editor

## Challenges
- Utilizing local storage and setting it up to have the todo cards persist upon refreshing the page, along with the completed tasks and the styling to persist.
- Figuring out how to get elements to have unique IDs so that I could manipulate them in the data model. Matching the ids of the task the user clicks on and the id of the task in the todo array was quite a difficult thing to do.

## Wins
- Wireframing and more planning at the beginning
- Stronger understanding of CSS and flexbox
- Getting a message to populate on the right side of the screen if there hasn't been any todo cards created yet. Once there are, the message goes away.
- More practice with JS
- More practice with classes and starting to understand more about the DOM and the data model

## Reflections
- Throughout this project, I learned that there is still so much that I need to learn and practice! But, I've also realized how far I've come. Even though I know there is still so much to learn, I feel comfortable with HTML and CSS. I'm also starting to get more comfortable with JS, but know there's still so much more I need to learn. I've also learned that Google is your friend.
